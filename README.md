REQUIREMENTS

You have to provide:
  * clang C++ compiler (can be changed to gcc in the first line of `build.fox`)
  * Python3
  * make
  * cmake

Rest of the dependencies is downloaded automatically!



BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

Run `make` to download/compile dependencies and build the project for the first time.

Run `./deps/bin/ninja` to (re)build the project later.

The binaries will be copied to project's main directory.



USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

Not available yet, sorry. Most of the binaries receive path to one image as the commandline input
and produce some files and windows with preview as the result.
Example:
`./tsp_art res/klaudia.jpg`
